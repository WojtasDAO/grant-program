Project Overview
Project: Hype Squad
Team Name: Hype Squad
Payment Address: 0xd719Bdf14616A6E48F936cc43343DEfE012c8AD3
Overview
We are building the first polish DAO community around blockchain and Web3 technology on various social media channels - Twitch, Discord, Twitter, etc. The main idea is to bring blockchain closer to the people, and at the beginning, members will not know that they are using blockchain to form, vote, and decide about the community's future. So the first part is to make the community use blockchain technology without knowing it's some new technology.



I agreed with Warsaw government entities to host around 1h presentation in 100 high schools in Warsaw about Web3 - it will be the leading way to reach out to new DAO members and future blockchain users at the beginning. It gives me around 500 students and 50 teachers reach per school - 55000 in total.

Lectures will start in January 2023.



The first acquisition of the members will be grapevine in the web3 community, the next presentation at schools, and giveaways. After we reach a certain point of members, we will start influencers marketing (lives, interviews, etc)



We have already made partnerships with the biggest communities and web3 projects in Poland, and we will announce it in Q1-Q2



We educate your people about web3, they will be the first real users of web3 - we have to show them the best projects in the spaces to start and make the first interaction.

What is more, our friends from Poland who used to work next to us are creators of the biggest marketplace on VeChain.

Project Details
We start our project together with lectures in High schools - at beginning of the 2023. RN we are making partnerships with web3 projects, polishing details with government entities in Warsaw, and planing activities.

Ecosystem Fit
In Poland, we have a few Polish-based NFT projects but they do not educate people + we have an "NFT Polska" community but they are more focused on NFT flipping etc.
